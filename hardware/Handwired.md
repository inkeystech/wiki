# Handwired Keyboards
Here you will find keyboards that can be built by hand without needing a PCB manufactured. These will usually include a 3D printed case as a foundation

## Handler

### Summary
I am a heavy user of a proprietary one-handed keyboard system. Recent maintenance issues and the lack of user serviceability have turned my attention to creating a more reliable solution. The result is the Handler Mark VII, my current prototype for a single-handed (110 mm length, 40mm girth) "dream" keyboard, the name referencing its proprietary competitor and fashion doll aesthetics.
