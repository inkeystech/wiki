## What We Ask

We *ask* you review the `Guidelines` section prior to asking for contributor access

## What We Require

We *require* the below `Guidelines` are met at all times.

## Requesting Access

If you'd still like access after reviewing the `Guidelines`, please join our documentation channel on Discord [channel invite here] and let us know you'd like to help. 

Once we see your message, we'll work with you to get setup and going for editing the wiki

## Guidelines

> Habitually failing to perform these guidelines will result in revoked access.
{.is-warning}

- Use markdown editors *exclusively*
- Tag every page
- Spell check every page prior to final save
- *ALL* content should be friendly to *ALL AGES*. If you're not sure, ask yourself if Disney could sell it to children without a riot erupting.
