## What We Require

We *require* the below `Guidelines` are met at all times.

## Requesting Access

If you'd still like access after reviewing the `Guidelines`, please join our documentation channel on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/e5uByzXCN9) and let us know you'd like to help. 

Once we see your message, we'll work with you to get setup and going for editing the knowledge base.

{.is-warning}

- Use markdown editors *exclusively*
- Tag every page
- Spell check every page prior to final save
- *ALL* content should be friendly to *ALL AGES*. If you're not sure
- Do *not* include the locale in any links to pages in the knowledge base. The underlying software is setup to handle locale/translations (where available) automatically
