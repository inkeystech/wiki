# artsey

[ARTSEY](https://artsey.io) is a one handed keyboard layout designed to fit onto just 8 keys.

On 2022/04/10 KemoNine (then maintainer of ARTSEY) forked the project and launched inkeys (this site) and [ardux](/keymaps/ardux) due to the founder of ARTSEY being on extended hiatus.

Please see the ardux knowledge base page or main artsey website for additional information.
