> **Please Note**: This page is a stub and is intended as such

[ARTSEY](https://artsey.io) is a one handed keyboard layout designed to fit onto just 8 keys and as of 2022/04/10 ARTSEY is no longer maintained.

> On 2022/04/10 KemoNine (then maintainer of ARTSEY) forked the project and launched inkeys (this site) and [ardux](/keymaps/ardux) due to the founder of ARTSEY being on extended hiatus.
