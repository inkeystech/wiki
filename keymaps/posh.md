# Posh (work in progress)

Posh is a [taipo](/en/keymaps/taipo) style layout that excludes the pinkies in order to make long periods of work more comfortable.

## Layout

Similar to taipo, the layout is two mirrored keyboards that are designed to be alternated between for each keypress. Here is the base layout, some things worth noting:

- Space and backspace are swapped
- Makes use of both thumb keys together in combos
- Space and backspace together is sticky shift

    BS SP   SP BS
