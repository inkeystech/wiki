## Inkeys Generative AI Policy
The Inkeys Admin Team do NOT support the use of generative models (AI) and will reject ANY code creating using these models from our codebases.

Our reasons include the further destruction of the Earth's climate, the total pillaging of the commons, the excessive slop that has permeated the web and open source community code repos, the re-packaging of content without attribution, unchecked hallucinations causing problems and so many more.

Inkeys is a project designed for humans by humans to help them in their daily lives. We are not a content farm and do not need generative models polluting our space.

## Knowledge Base Specific

> **ALL** login methods will expose your account e-mail address to the admins of this site. This is a very small list of humans and the few that have access are listed under the `Ownership` section.
